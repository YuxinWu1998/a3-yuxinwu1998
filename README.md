## Yuxin Wu | Daily Water Calculator

I make a simple but interesting daily water calculator which lets you calculate the water (in Oz.) you and your family needs everyday easily! Name, Age, Exercise Mins and Weight are basic fields. Water is the calculated field.


## Technical Achievements
- **XML REQUEST**: I used XMLHTTPRequests to send data between the client and the server by the GET and POST requests in index.html and serveral functions in server.js and scripts.js.
- **USAGE OF CSS**: I used CSS to beautify the website.
- **SCRIPT IN HTML**: I used javascript in the front-end (in the html) to change the format of the website according to the options that the user selects.
- **THE HIDDEN INPUT**: There is a hidden input which makes the transition of the id very easy. 
- **REMEMBER YOUR INPUTS**: Our website could "remember" the users' input. The input won't change or disappear.
- **THE REAL SERVER**: As required by the task requirement, this project could store the data forever and use it again and again.
- **CRUD**: As required by the task requirement, this project allows the user commits CRUD actions.
- **MONGODB**: This project is connected with mongoDB to store the data.
- **FAVICON**: I desgined the unique favicon for this project and implemented it.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **ANIMATIONS**: I added animations to the buttons and the websites to make them more beautiful. (The animations are inspired by Da Xu's project. I have already got his permission to use his code for the animations of the webpage and some button.)
- **FONT SELECTION**: I used the Raleway font, which is a Humanistic Scans Serif font, for the whole html for the purpose of readability and beauty.
- **COLOR COMBINATION**: I only used different kinds of blue in this html, which makes the website clear and beautiful.
- **STYLE CONSISTENCY**: I used the flat design to make the website more beautiful and clear.
- **CLEAR LAYOUT**: The layout is simple and clear, which is really friendly to all kinds of users to use.
